# Auto4n6
Auto4n6 is a set of AchoirX Scripts coupled with several other Open Source forensics programs that automate the parsing and reporting of both Memory dumps and Forensic Triage collections.
Auto4n6 currently requires quite a bit of customised configuration to identify how a triage collection should be parsed.  Future versions will focus on better ways to determine how to parse and process collection data with less configuration.
